This blog post is a comprehensive brain dump of everything I know about fundraising. Read this in entirety before our first pitch clinic. We'll talk about N things. This applies to pre-seed, seed, and Series A fundraising, although the lessons almost certainly generalize. 

The best way to raise money is to build a really good business, and then make it really obvious to investors that the business is really good. There is no substitute for building a really good business. 

Paul Graham's a universal theory of VC suckage is mandatory reading; you can find it here: https://www.paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html

TODO: write more here


Your goal when you're raising a financing round is to get to two term sheets. If you back-calculate from that, what this means is that you want to run a highly competitive process. This means you want to be taking all of your meetings at the same time. So you want to get all of your intros done in the same week. You want to get all of your first meetings done in the same week, your second meetings done in the same week. You want to treat, et cetera. You want to treat this like a funnel. 

This process will be grueling. For most of the time that you are fundraising, you will not have any term sheets in hand and most of your round will be undersubscribed. For my Luminous Seed round, I initially went out to raise a $6M round. For 3 months, my round was undersubscribed with only 1.5 out of the 6 filled. We got 2 term sheets from lead investors on the same day, and within 48 hours, we had $15M of commits that we had to trim down to 9. 

So much of this process is being willing to weather out the storm more than anyone else. 

Ultimately your leverage in any financing round is your willingness to walk away from a deal. One way you can walk away from the deal is to not need the money. As an example if your cash flow positive you won't need capital so you are willing to walk away from any deal therefore you are in the position of strength. Getting two term sheets is the other way to get leverage; if you have another alternative then you're in a position of strength in the negotiation 

One thing you want to determine when you're raising is how much to raise. There are a few questions that I think about when I'm figuring out what is the right round, size of a round. One is, will the capital materially change the value of the business in a nonlinear way? So, if I invest a million dollars at a $10 million valuation, will you be able to come back in 18 to 24 months and have a business that's worth 30? Or 40 million? 

The time scale that you're operating on is typically 18 to 24 months. A VC is typically thinking about investing in you for 18 to 24 months of additional runway to get you to that inflection point. 

Even really good venture capitalists operate seasonally. So they go on vacation after Memorial Day and they go on vacation after Thanksgiving. So when you kick off a fundraise, your goal is to have a term sheet before everyone disappears for the holidays. If you have a term sheet by Memorial Day or by Thanksgiving, that final month can be used to get through sort of typical legal due diligence. But that's the latest that you can get a term sheet. Fundraises typically take anywhere from one to four months if run competitively. And so what this means is that the two windows that you can kick off a raise in any given year are January to April and September to October. 

Don't fundraise in the summer. I've never seen a fundraise go successfully in the summer. 

OK, so you want to run a funnel. So how do we run a funnel? The first thing you need is top of funnel. In a typical VC raise for a pre-seed, seed or series A, you want to be taking 20 to 30 first meetings, in order to get to two to three term sheets at the end. Depending on the nature of the connections that you had to those VCs, that realistically means that you want about double that. So call it 50 to 60 funds at the top of the funnel.

There are a few ways to get intros. The easiest way and by far the most effective way is to have your existing investors make the introductions for you. Typically what I do is I create a tracker of all of the funds that I would be potentially interested in meeting and I send that tracker to all the VCs that are already on my cap table and I ask them to fill out which ones they would be willing to make an introduction to. An example of what such a tracker looks like is here: [INSERT LINK]

Know importantly that when you're identifying introductions to funds, you don't just want to identify the fund itself but you also want to know who is the person at the fund that you want to meet. Sometimes the person you want to meet won't be the person that you do meet. The main thing that you are filtering for however is their level of seniority. You want to be meeting with partners, not associates or principals. Partners are the ones who actually make decisions in IC, not the principal or the associate. If you go through one of the principal or associate channels, you have a dramatically lower likelihood of your deal getting exposed or getting done. They will express over confidence in their ability to do deals, but the math doesn't speak for that. 

Also, if you're raising anything more than $1M, you're probably going to have a lead investor. When you are generating this list, you want to be focusing on the places that can lead a round. The places that only follow won't make decisions until there's a lead, and once there is a lead, they will make decisions very quickly. 

Ideally, for any given fund that you want to hit, you have two connections to the fund. One person who can directly make an introduction and another person who can back channel or send support. In practice, this is very difficult to achieve and so, you know, for most funds you'll probably only have one and not two. 

You want to make this as early as possible. You'll see this in the Gantt chart below. The reason is if you don't have Top of Funnel there are things that you can do to generate Top of Funnel. However, you need to know what your current state is of top of funnel right away.

If you don't have Top of Funnel, there are a few other avenues for getting introductions that are highly effective. 
1. Other founders
2. Building an advisory board
3. Cold outreach

Other founders that are in your network that you're close with can absolutely make introductions. Depending on the nature of the relationship with the founders and the investors, those introductions can range from very weak to very, very strong. I discourage you from taking introductions from founders to VCs, unless the founder has actually worked with the VC before. Otherwise, the introduction will probably not be credible. 

Another thing you can do is build an advisory board. This is particularly effective for people who are not currently in the Silicon Valley ecosystem. The way you go about doing this is as follows: Identify potential advisors. These will almost certainly be former founders or former operators. They will probably not be current venture capitalists, because current venture capitalists will be conflicted out. You then can build those relationships over the course of anywhere from two weeks to three months. Give them a piece of equity and get both business strategy advice and also introductions. 

My template for how to get advisors engaged goes as follows:

I bring them in, I walk them through the business in excruciating detail. I walk them through all of the technical details, I walk them through all of the business strategy, I walk them through every part of the business, and then I ask them to tear me apart. They tear me apart and they give me a bunch of holes. Then I go away for a week and I sit and I work with my team and I try to patch the holes. I come back and I show them the new plan and I say "rip me up again". They rip me up again. We repeat this three or four times. After the third or fourth time, what I've consistently found is that advisors will tend to no longer be able to generate reasons that the business will fail and will naturally be bought in. At that point, once they are bought in, is the time when it is appropriate to ask them for introductions. If you ask a potential advisor to be in a, to make introductions for you before they're bought in, the strength of the introductions will be weak. This, of course, generalizes and also applies to asking for intros to other founders or even from people on your cap table. 

When someone introduces you to a VC, you should assume that the VC is going to ask the person who introduced you, "What do you think of this company?" And you want them to say strong things. You would ideally like them to say, "I would like to write a check" or "I am investing my time in this business because I believe it will succeed." Your effectiveness will go down super-linearly as a function of how bearish they are on you. 

There are a few other important points of necessary preparations. One is the assembly of a data room. A data room includes literally every single document you have ever signed on behalf of the company. This includes formation documents, any documents documenting past financings, your company charter, past board meeting minutes, past shareholder communications, any contracts you've signed with customers or vendors, any employee agreements, all of the IP, including patents. Any law suits that are ongoing. All NDAs (yes NDAs can be weird!). Btw, the best way to make a really good Data Room is to continually have the Data Room as an ongoing activity and just always upload signed documents to it. 


Once you've assembled a list of people who can make introductions and done all the necessary prep, the next thing to do is to prepare to actually receive those introductions. You want to time this. All of the introductions should come in - should be all of the introductory notes sent out at the same day, probably within the same few hours, so that all of the meetings can be scheduled at the same time. 

The most effective way to make the introductions happen is as follows: For every introducer-introducee pair, you will send a unique email to the introducer. The email should look something like below:

[INSERT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE]

It includes a specific reference to the venture capitalist you'd like the introduction to, or fund you'd like the introduction to, as well as a blurb about the business and ideally also a blurb about you. These blurbs should be 2-4 sentences long. They shouldn't be long, but they should be enough that a venture capitalist would be interested in taking a meeting with you. These do not need to be comprehensive. This is not a send-ahead deck. This is just a hook so that the combination of the hook and the strength of the relationship of the introducer and the introducee gets you in the room. 

You're then going to schedule all of your meetings to occur at the same time. Remember, we are running a competitive process. All of your first meetings should happen in the same week. This will be a highly intense process. As I mentioned before, you will not be doing anything other than fundraising when you are fundraising. A typical calendar for a seed or series A fundraise in the first week of meetings has 20 to 30 meetings scheduled back-to-back. These are typically 30 to 45 minute meetings. 

In a first meeting, you have two really important goals. The first thing you need to do is to tell the VC about your business. We'll talk later about what a good pitch looks like. The second thing you need to do is to understand the VC's process. Every VC operates differently, but typically, there is a weekly investment committee meeting where they will decide to move forward in understanding deals. They will decide to do deals or go into diligence with deals, and they will decide to actually execute deals. Depending on the fund, sometimes the decision is unilateral by a single partner depending on the fund, size of fund and size of deal. Sometimes the decision requires a vote, a majority vote. Sometimes the deal requires unanimous votes. Every fund you talk to will operate differently, and it's important to understand at least the first order of the process so you can manage to understand where you are in that process as you continue to meet with them. 

Never leave a meeting with the VC without establishing a next step. e.g. when should we touch base next?

Eventually, if a venture capitalist decides to invest, the next thing they will do is give you a term sheet. This is a non-binding but strong offer to invest in your company. When you're evaluating a term sheet, there are a few items that you want to consider. 
- How much money is being invested?
- What is the pre-money or post-money valuation prescribed?
- How much money is the lead investor investing vs. how much are you responsible for funding?
- Is the round being done on a safe, a convertible note, or is it a priced equity round?
- Are you giving up a port seat?
- What controls does the investor directly or indirectly have on your business? Direct means they have a sole veto or a sole control. Indirect means preferred as a class - majority preferred as a class has the right, and the venture capitalist controls enough that they effectively control the majority. Some terms that I've seen include veto on future financings. Veto on M&A. Veto on changes to founder compensation or employee compensation. Vetoes on the amount of debt that you can take on. Vetos on the amount that you can spend without board authorization.
- Does all the money come in at once, or does it come in in tranches? [NOTE ABOUT TRAUNCHED ROUNDS]
- pro rata rights (regular or super or none)

At this point, you're in a position to negotiate. If you have two term sheets and you've timed it right, the term sheets will show up at the same time, and you can pit them against each other. If you don't have a second term sheet, you still have options but you are often times at the mercy of the investor if you don't have the ability to walk away from a bad deal. 

One tactic I've used in the past is to run the negotiation without my co-founders in the room. Then if the VC offers a bad term, I can say something to the effect of "Look, I want to do this deal with you, but if I brought this deal back to my co-founders, they just wouldn't go for it." You create an artificial enemy and temporarily throw your co-founders under the bus (not actually) in order to push VCs to do better and give you better terms. But fundamentally, if they don't have to give you better terms, they are less likely to actually cave. 

Once you sign the term sheet, for a pre-seed or seed that's typically the end of the process. Typically you'll be investing on a safe note. And so you'll just send the safe and wire immediately. Do not wait to ask someone to wire immediately after they sign a safe. The moment someone signs a safe, you should have them wire immediately. I have seen many founders sign safes, not ask investors to wire, and this gives investors time to change their mind. The game theory here is that investors will bet that founders will be unlikely to sue them. I see this more with angel investors than I do with actual VC funds, but the strength of a contract is only in its enforceability, and founder code says you're not allowed to sue your VCs. So just minimize the time for them to say no. Have them wire right away. 

For a Series A round, you'll likely then enter legal due diligence. This includes mainly examination of the data room and the generation of deal docs.

You'll also have the opportunity to make reps and warranties. These are representations that the investor will ask you to make on behalf of the company about the state of the company. This is your opportunity to disclose all of the baggage that the company has. Many founders have the instinct to say as little as possible here, you should index the other way. You should say as much as possible. You should come up with all of the possible things that can go wrong with your business. If you don't include those in the representations and warranties, then you can be sued for not including them, not making fair and accurate representations. 


[INSERT NOTE ABOUT SIDE LETTERS]

One of the things that you're evaluating when you get a term sheet is the term sheet itself and how it materially impacts your business. The more important thing to be evaluating in my opinion is the quality of the investor that you're working with. Working with venture capitalists is a pretty scary proposition. You're signing up for a 10-year relationship having not really known this person that well. It would be like pre-agreeing to marry someone before you've ever met them. And of course, because they want to win your deal, which they've signified by giving you a term sheet, they're inclined to give you the best representation of themselves, and so you are unlikely to see the bad part. 

If you're vetting a VC, the best way to bet then is by asking for references. You should also run your own cold references since venture capitalists are likely to give you references that are positive. 

When you run these reference checks, here are the questions I would typically ask:
- How long have you worked with this VC?
- What percentile are they in terms of helpfulenss to work with?
- Are they an active or passive investor?
- When things go bad, are they your first phone call or how early do you call them?
- Have you been through a difficult situation with them and have they supported you? 

The #1 thing founders get wrong is running their fundraisers in series instead of in parallel. This both destroys any urgency and doesn't give you the leverage to push people onto your timelines, and also eliminates the possibility of getting to two term sheets at the same time. Funds take weeks, not days, and sometimes months to invest, so running every one at the same time is really important for running a competitive process and from being able to walk away from a bad deal. If you take nothing else away from this article, take this piece away. 

Another thing I see founders get wrong a lot is failing to focus. When you're running a fundraise, your fundraise is your primary activity. At Luminous, when I was fundraising, I would frequently delegate 70-80% of my internal responsibilities to the rest of my team. One time I even designated a temporary interim CEO so I could finish closing around. Your number one job is to close the fundraise as fast as possible, especially if you are running a mission-critical fundraise. Everything else is secondary priority. Your response time to any given VC should be no more than 24 hours. Realistically, it should be 6 hours. 

If you're raising less than $10M, you should probably use a safe note and not run a priced round. A safe note is a YC standard document for accelerated seed, pre-seed, and seed funding. It's an agreement to issue equity at a given price or a given discount at a future date. Typically, the note is constructed as investing a set amount of money at a cap or a discount. It means that the money will be issued into shares at the lesser of the next priced round's price valuation and the cap. Discount means exactly what it sounds like, a discount to the next round's valuation. Typically, there will be no governance provisions attached to a SAFE, and there are very few other terms you need to consider. Because you can download the SAFE off the internet, the legal cost of actually issuing the SAFE is close to nothing, allowing you to minimize the amount of time and capital spent on fundraising logistics and maximize the amount of time you spend either fundraising or getting back to building your business. 

If you're raising more than $10 million, you will probably be taking that money as a priced round. This is where you actually issue equity. This will come with all of the necessary bells and whistles I referenced earlier, like extensive due diligence, representations, and warranties, and a data room. A typical priced round will run you anywhere from $10,000 to $25,000 in lawyer fees. So it's probably not worth it if you're an early-stage business.
