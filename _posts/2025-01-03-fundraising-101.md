# Fundraising 101 DRAFT

This blog post is a comprehensive brain dump of everything I know about fundraising. Read this in entirety before our first pitch clinic. We'll talk about N things. This applies to pre-seed, seed, and Series A fundraising, although the lessons almost certainly generalize.

## Introduction

The best way to raise money is to **build a really good business**, and then make it very obvious to investors that the business is really good. There is no substitute for building something that stands on its own merits.

Paul Graham’s “A Universal Theory of VC Suckage” is [mandatory reading](https://www.paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html).

## On Competitive Processes and Leverage

The number one thing founders mess up when running a fundraise is running the raise in sequence, instead in parallel. They speak to a single VC, who drags their feet forever, and once that VC says no, they move to the next VC. This process is slow, and there's nothing to create urgency to move quickly. Investors also use whether other investors are interested as a proxy for whether or not you are the fund returner, so if you're not talking to other people (or if you've been rejected a bunch), they'll be less inclined to invest. VCs truly have a sixth sense about this stuff, so even if you don't say anything they'll be able to read it on your face. 

So, how do you run a raise correctly?

Let's start with the goal. Your goal when you run a fundraise to get to at least **two term sheets at roughly the same time**. Back-calculate from that: you want to run a highly competitive process, where all of your meetings (introductory, first, second, etc.) happen during the same time window. You're running all VCs in parallel, not sequentially. 

We do this for a few reasons, ranked in order of importance:
1. Leverage
2. Forced Timeline
3. Signal

Let's talk through each of these

### 1. Leverage

You need to have leverage to get good terms, and your primary form of leverage in fundraising is your ability to walk away from a bad deal. One way to be able to walk away is simply not needing the money (e.g., being cash-flow positive or having sufficient cash reserves). Another way is having multiple term sheets on the table.

### 2. Forced Timeline

By default, the VC is in control of their own process. They want to take as much time as possible to figure out whether or not you're a fund returner, since they get limited at bats. So their inclination is to drag their feet for as long as possible. If you are talking to many VCs at once, they can't drag their feet, or they might lose the deal to a competitors, and there are simply not enough fund returners for them to afford to take that risk.

### 3. Signal

Ironically, the more you are already able to walk away from a bad deal, the more interested VCs will be in your business. This is why oftentimes the best time to fundraise is precisely when you don't need the money. Running a process properly is also a signal of this (since VCs will know you are talking to other VCs), so structuring a fundraise in parallel instead of sequentially **literally makes you more attractive to investors**. 

So you're going to run your fundraise in parallel, not in sequence. 

## Weathering the Storm
So much of fundraising is about enduring uncertainty. This can be a grueling endeavor. For most of your fundraising process, you will be undersubscribed, and be seeing a large batch of rejections. But because VCs view other VC interest in you as a signal of being a fund returner, the moment you get a first term sheet, your situation will dramatically change and you will likely become oversubscribed astonishingly quickly. This is a consistent pattern. 

For example, in my Luminous Seed round, I initially set out to raise \$6M. For three months, the round was undersubscribed at \$1.5M, only including insiders and a few angels. Then, **two term sheets** arrived on the same day, and within 48 hours I had \$15M of commitments—which I ended up trimming down to \$9M.

---

## How Much Should You Raise?

One of the first questions to ask: **How big should the round be?** Generally, investors look for a financing that covers about 18–24 months of runway, by which point you’ve reached a significant **inflection point** in your company’s value. E.g. if you invest \$1M at a \$10M valuation, can you come back in 12-18 months and be worth \$30M or \$40M? If the new capital materially and nonlinearly increases the company’s value, you’re probably on the right track.

For a typical venture backed company, the expectation (given fund vintage time) is that you will raise your next round within 18-24 months. Since you don't want to go and fundraise with most of your cash used up, you're probably kicking off a raise within 12-18 months. So you want the cash to take you to an inflection point by that time period.

Another factor to consider when sizing your round is how fast you can fill it up. How much are your insiders willing to put in? How big are the checks that the people in your funnel can write. Unintuitively, I frequently tell founders to raise less (not more), and size up later if they're oversubscribed, because it makes it easier to get to oversubcription. 

Also for scale reference, at this moment in time (Q1 2025), expectations for Series A seem to be $1M-$2M ARR as table stakes. Series A amounts range wildly from $10M - $100M.

## Seasonality of Venture Capital

Even great VCs operate on a kind of calendar. No one really has documented why, but it happens, and it is consistent. VCs typically go on vacation after Memorial Day and after Thanksgiving. So, if you kick off a round in the early summer or deep fall, you risk missing critical windows. Your goal is to get to a term sheet before those dead days, which means your best fundraise kickoff windows are January to April and September to October.

Don’t try fundraising in the summer. Every round I've seen that's been kicked off in the summer has failed. Fundraising often takes **1–4 months** if done competitively, so plan accordingly.

## Building Top of Funnel

If you’re targeting a **pre-seed, seed, or Series A**, expect to take 20–30 first meetings in order to close with 2–3 term sheets. In reality, you probably need 50–60 prospective funds at the top of the funnel because not all intros convert into meetings. In order to get top of funnel, you'll need to source introductions

1. **Your existing investors.**  
   - Create a tracker of potential funds and email it to your current investors, asking who can introduce you where.  
   - An example of such a tracker: [INSERT LINK]  

2. **Other founders.**  
   - Ideally, get an introduction from founders who have actually worked with that VC before. Otherwise, the introduction won’t carry much weight. 

3. **Advisory board.**  
   - If you don't have connections to existing VCs, one thing you can do is create an advisory board -- could include industry luminaries, retired founders or investors, or others. My playbook for advisors is always the same, and can be found here: [INSERT LINK]. Once you bring them on as an advisor and get their buy in, only then do you ask for an introduction. 

4. **Cold outreach.**  
   - I'd basically avoid this unless the VC has explicitly solicited cold outreach. 

When you're evaluating introductions, one thing to pay attention to is the seniority of the VC. You're targeting partner-level and up; associates and principals do occassionally do deals, but the barrier for them to push a deal through is high, and the influence they have is low. 

Also, this is embedded in the above advice but worth stating explicitly. What the introducer thinks of you matters. This is why you work with your existings (who are literally financially aligned), but with founders or advisors, you have to spend the time to get their buy in. The VC will almost always call the introducer and ask for their candid opinion -- you want people who will rave about you. 

Lastly, what the VC thinks of the introducer also matters a great deal. Getting an introduction from someone on your cap table is usually better than getting an introduction from a friend. 

You should assess your top of funnel *immediately*. If it’s weak, you’ll need time to build it, whether via new relationships, an advisory board, or warm intros. The process of getting people to fill out a spreadsheet and/or bringing on advisors can be long, and you can't kick off a raise until you have the top of funnel. 

### Importance of Building a Good Cap Table Early On

One thing that falls out of this being your process is -- when you're raising a pre-seed or seed round, one of the things you should be evaluating is whether or not your investors can introduce you to the people who will fund your next round. I've seen so many rounds fail on the basis of simply not having requisite top of funnel. Given that your ability to raise your next round is determined so much by your ability to run a competitive process, choosing investors who can help you succeed here is crucial. 

You should be asking this during your reference checks (more on this later). 

---

## Data Room
One thing that (mostly Series A and beyond) investors will ask for is a data room. This is a database of every document that's relevant to the business, including but not limited to:
- Formation docs
- Prior financing docs
- Board minutes and decks
- NDAs
- Patents
- Employee agreements
- Financial models
- Anything else that has C-level signatures on it
- Any outstanding legal matters that the business is involved with

It's easier to just as a policy maintain a constant database of this, rather than having to go scrounge everything up in a rush when you get asked. This process can oftentimes take weeks if you have to do it last minute. 

---

## How to Receive an Introduction

When you ask for an introduction, you should send each introducer a separate forwardble email for each VC you'd like them to introduce you to. They'll then ideally forward the email to the VC with a bit of their own commentary, and if the VC is interested in an introduction, they'll say yes, and the introducer will add you to the thread. An example sequence of this is below, where I am introducing <FOUNDER> to  <VC>:

Thank you so much for your time! 

<FOUNDER>

```

What this means is that before you can kick off your process, you also need a short blurb on your company and a short blurb on the founders. This blurb doesn't need to be comprehensive -- it's just a hook to get someone interested enough in you to take a meeting.

## Getting Insider Pre-Commitments

[TODO: FILL OUT]

---
## Other Minor TODOs

You should probably set up a calendly, or you can schedule by hand. With the volume of introductions that's coming in, the logistical overhead of scheduling meetings for a raise will get hefty. 

---
## Final Note: Fundraising Mode Is On or Off


---

## Kicking off a process

Your checklist is as follows:
- Do you have all introductions ready to go? (You have confirmed warm connections in the past 30 days for all 50-60 introductions)
- Do you have your blurb written?
- Do you have your deck written?
- Do you have your data room assembled?
- Have you chosen the amount you want to raise?

If these are all assembled, you're ready to kick off your process. 

A week before you formally open the fundraise, you will send all introduction emails out on the same day. You should handhold your introducers; all emails should get forwarded to the VCs. Call every introducer if needed, make sure they have the ammunition they need (this should just be forwardable email). 

If the VC opts in, they will usually add their admin to help schedule. Be kind to admins -- they do really hard work, and the impression you leave matters. 


---

## What Happens in the First Meeting?

1. **Explain your business.**  
   - (See [TODO: WHAT A GOOD PITCH LOOKS LIKE] for more details.)

2. **Learn the VC’s process.**  
   - How do they decide to go into diligence?  
   - What’s their typical timeline?  
   - Do they need unanimous partner approval, a majority vote, or can a single partner write a check?  

3. **Never leave without a next step.**  
   - Ask, “When should we talk again?” or “When’s your next IC meeting?”

---

## Evaluating Term Sheets

Eventually, if the VC wants to proceed, you’ll receive a **term sheet** (a non-binding but strong offer). Key considerations include:

- **Investment amount**  
- **Pre- or post-money valuation**  
- **Breakdown**: lead investor’s portion vs. how much you need to fill  
- **Instrument**: SAFE, convertible note, or priced equity?  
- **Board seat**: Are you giving one up?  
- **Controls**: Any vetos on future financing, M&A, founder comp, debt limits, etc.?  
- **Tranches**: Do you get all the money at once, or is it split? ([NOTE ABOUT TRAUNCHED ROUNDS])  
- **Pro rata**: Regular, super, or none?

If you have **two term sheets** at once, you can pit them against each other and negotiate better terms. If not, you may have less leverage—though you still have some tactics.

**Pro tip**: In negotiations, sometimes you can say, “I want to do this deal, but my co-founders won’t accept these terms.” This creates an external party to “blame” for standing firm on certain provisions without burning the relationship yourself.

---

## After Signing a Term Sheet

### For Pre-Seed or Seed

You’re probably on a **SAFE** (recommended if you’re raising < \$10M). It’s a straightforward agreement with minimal governance. Ask for the **wire** immediately after the SAFE is signed. Unfortunate as it is, sometimes investors drag their feet.

### For a Series A

You’ll likely enter **legal due diligence**, which can involve $10K–\$25K in legal fees. You’ll also have to provide **reps and warranties**—truthful disclosures about your business’s state and potential issues. If you omit something material, you can be sued later, so err on the side of over-disclosure.

[INSERT NOTE ABOUT SIDE LETTERS]

---

## Choosing the Right VC

Of course, term sheets matter, but the **investor relationship** matters even more. You’re effectively signing a **10-year partnership** with someone you might know only a few weeks. They’re on their best behavior now, so seek references.

Ask references:  
- How long have they worked with this VC?  
- What percentile are they in helpfulness?  
- Are they active or passive?  
- What happened when things went wrong—did they help?
- Intros

Run your own *cold* reference checks because the VC will naturally give you references they know will sound positive.

---


## Final Thoughts

If you take nothing else away, take this: **run all your meetings in parallel** so you can build leverage, and never forget that the only sure way to “win” in fundraising is to build a company VCs can’t resist.
