# Fundraising 101

This blog post is a comprehensivebrain dump of everything I know about fundraising. Read this in entirety before our first pitch clinic. We'll talk about N things. This applies to pre-seed, seed, and Series A fundraising, although the lessons almost certainly generalize. 

0. Best way to raise money
The best way to raise money is to build a really good business, and then make it really obvious to investors that the business is really good. There is no substitute for building a really good business. 

1. Know your partner: How VCs make money
Paul Graham's a universal theory of VC suckage is mandatory reading; you can find it here: https://www.paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html

2. Fundraising strategy and GANTT chart

Your goal when you're raising a financing round is to get to two term sheets. If you back-calculate from that, what this means is that you want to run a highly competitive process. This means you want to be taking all of your meetings at the same time. So you want to get all of your intros done in the same week. You want to get all of your first meetings done in the same week, your second meetings done in the same week. You want to treat, et cetera. You want to treat this like a funnel. 

Ultimately your leverage in any financing round is your willingness to walk away from a deal. One way you can walk away from the deal is to not need the money. As an example if your cash flow positive you won't need capital so you are willing to walk away from any deal therefore you are in the position of strength. Getting two term sheets is the other way to get leverage; if you have another alternative then you're in a position of strength in the negotiation 

One thing you want to determine when you're raising is how much to raise. There are a few questions that I think about when I'm figuring out what is the right round, size of a round. One is, will the capital materially change the value of the business in a nonlinear way? So, if I invest a million dollars at a $10 million valuation, will you be able to come back in 18 to 24 months and have a business that's worth 30? Or 40 million? 

The time scale that you're operating on is typically 18 to 24 months. A VC is typically thinking about investing in you for 18 to 24 months of additional runway to get you to that inflection point. 

Even really good venture capitalists operate seasonally. So they go on vacation after Memorial Day and they go on vacation after Thanksgiving. So when you kick off a fundraise, your goal is to have a term sheet before everyone disappears for the holidays. If you have a term sheet by Memorial Day or by Thanksgiving, that final month can be used to get through sort of typical legal due diligence. But that's the latest that you can get a term sheet. Fundraises typically take anywhere from one to four months if run competitively. And so what this means is that the two windows that you can kick off a raise in any given year are January to April and September to October. 

Don't fundraise in the summer. I've never seen a fundraiser go successfully in the summer. 

OK, so you want to run a funnel. So how do we run a funnel? The first thing you need is top of funnel. In a typical VC raise for a pre-seed, seed or series A, you want to be taking 20 to 30 first meetings, in order to get to two to three term sheets at the end. Depending on the nature of the connections that you had to those VCs, that realistically means that you want about double that. So call it 50 to 60 funds at the top of the funnel.

There are a few ways to get intros. The easiest way and by far the most effective way is to have your existing investors make the introductions for you. Typically what I do is I create a tracker of all of the funds that I would be potentially interested in meeting and I send that tracker to all the VCs that are already on my cap table and I ask them to fill out which ones they would be willing to make an introduction to. An example of what such a tracker looks like is here: [INSERT LINK]

Ideally, for any given fund that you want to hit, you have two connections to the fund. One person who can directly make an introduction and another person who can back channel or send support. In practice, this is very difficult to achieve and so, you know, for most funds you'll probably only have one and not two. 

You want to make this as early as possible. You'll see this in the Gantt chart below. The reason is if you don't have Top of Funnel there are things that you can do to generate Top of Funnel. However, you need to know what your current state is of top of funnel right away.

If you don't have Top of Funnel, there are a few other avenues for getting introductions that are highly effective. 
1. Other founders
2. Building an advisory board
3. Cold outreach

Other founders that are in your network that you're close with can absolutely make introductions. Depending on the nature of the relationship with the founders and the investors, those introductions can range from very weak to very, very strong. I discourage you from taking introductions from founders to VCs, unless the founder has actually worked with the VC before. Otherwise, the introduction will probably not be credible. 

Another thing you can do is build an advisory board. This is particularly effective for people who are not currently in the Silicon Valley ecosystem. The way you go about doing this is as follows: Identify potential advisors. These will almost certainly be former founders or former operators. They will probably not be current venture capitalists, because current venture capitalists will be conflicted out. You then can build those relationships over the course of anywhere from two weeks to three months. Give them a piece of equity and get both business strategy advice and also introductions. 

My template for how to get advisors engaged goes as follows:

I bring them in, I walk them through the business in excruciating detail. I walk them through all of the technical details, I walk them through all of the business strategy, I walk them through every part of the business, and then I ask them to tear me apart. They tear me apart and they give me a bunch of holes. Then I go away for a week and I sit and I work with my team and I try to patch the holes. I come back and I show them the new plan and I say "rip me up again". They rip me up again. We repeat this three or four times. After the third or fourth time, what I've consistently found is that advisors will tend to no longer be able to generate reasons that the business will fail and will naturally be bought in. At that point, once they are bought in, is the time when it is appropriate to ask them for introductions. If you ask a potential advisor to be in a, to make introductions for you before they're bought in, the strength of the introductions will be weak. This, of course, generalizes and also applies to asking for intros to other founders or even from people on your cap table. 

When someone introduces you to a VC, you should assume that the VC is going to ask the person who introduced you, "What do you think of this company?" And you want them to say strong things. You would ideally like them to say, "I would like to write a check" or "I am investing my time in this business because I believe it will succeed." Your effectiveness will go down super-linearly as a function of how bearish they are on you. 

Once you've assembled a list of people who can make introductions, the next thing to do is to prepare to actually receive those introductions. You want to time this. All of the introductions should come in - should be all of the introductory notes sent out at the same day, probably within the same few hours, so that all of the meetings can be scheduled at the same time. 

The most effective way to make the introductions happen is as follows: For every introducer-introducee pair, you will send a unique email to the introducer. The email will probably look something like below:
