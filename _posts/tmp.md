# Fundraising 101 DRAFT

There’s a cliché you’ll hear over and over when raising money: *The best way to raise money is to build a really good business.* And, at the risk of sounding repetitive, it’s true. No deck, no pitch, no connections, and no fancy intros can solve the problem of having a bad or mediocre business. Once you accept that, you can focus on the second half of the trick: *making it really obvious to investors that your business is good.* That’s fundraising in a nutshell.

We’ll talk about all sorts of fundraising details here, from when to start your process, to how to build a top of funnel, to evaluating term sheets. If you read this carefully before our first pitch clinic, you’ll be better prepared to run a competitive process, field tough questions, and manage your timelines. [TODO: WHAT A GOOD PITCH LOOKS LIKE] and [TODO: INSERT QUESTION LIST AND DRILL GAME] are still works in progress, but those sections will fill out this guide. Everything here applies primarily to pre-seed, seed, and Series A, though most of the lessons generalize.

Remember to read Paul Graham’s excellent essay, *A Unified Theory of VC Suckage*, [mandatory reading here](https://www.paulgraham.com/venturecapital.html). It’ll help you understand why VCs can sometimes act the way they do.

## The Ultimate Goal: Two Term Sheets

Your immediate goal in fundraising is to get to two term sheets at the same time. It’s what gives you leverage. When you have two investors vying for you, everything magically becomes negotiable: valuation, board seats, deal terms, you name it. The only way to get two term sheets at the same time, though, is to run a *highly competitive process*—to funnel all your meetings into a tight window so that no single VC thinks they can drag things out while you wait around.

Of course, timing your process is stressful. If you ever do a big raise, you’ll experience the long, slow grind with no term sheets in hand, and everyone waiting to see if someone else will blink first. Then, occasionally, you’ll get multiple offers in the same week. That’s when the dynamic shifts.

A personal example: when I raised for Luminous, we wanted \$6M, and for three months we were stuck at \$1.5M. Suddenly, two term sheets showed up on the same day, and within 48 hours we found ourselves at \$15M in commits, ultimately trimming down to \$9M. *Most of fundraising is about outlasting everyone else*—staying in the game until momentum flips in your favor.

## Knowing Your Partner (How VCs Make Money)

It’s helpful to remember that venture capitalists have partners, limited partners, and internal dynamics that shape how they invest. Most VC funds operate on an 18-to-24-month horizon for your company. That’s how long they hope your new capital will last. Often, they also have seasonal cycles—fundraising after Memorial Day or Thanksgiving can become tricky because many of them go on vacation (and your process drags out).

If you’re aiming for a quick timeline, think in terms of two big windows per year: **January to April**, and **September to October**. You want a term sheet before everyone disappears for the holidays. *Don’t try to raise in the summer.* You might as well open a lemonade stand on Mars.

---

## How Much to Raise

One of the first questions you’ll face is: *How much money should I raise?* There’s no perfect formula, but the main lens is: **Will the new capital change your company’s value in a non-linear way, within the next 18–24 months?** If you think you can meaningfully boost your valuation through specific milestones, then you have a good case for raising enough to get you there.

## Running the Funnel

### Top of Funnel

To get 2–3 solid term sheets, you likely need 20–30 first meetings with VCs. Usually, that means you need 50–60 funds at the top of your list, because a lot of intros won’t go anywhere. The best way to get these intros is through your existing investors—they’ll likely have a strong network and can do the heavy lifting. 

Create a simple tracker (spreadsheet or otherwise) of all the VCs you’d like to meet and share it with your cap table. [INSERT LINK] would go here once you have an example. Ask them which intros they can credibly make, and which partners in each fund to target. You always want to talk to a *partner*. Associates and principals can seem enthusiastic, but they seldom have the authority to champion you through to an actual term sheet.

If you need more leads, you can also look to (1) other founders you know (especially if they’ve *actually worked with* a given VC), or (2) building an advisory board of experienced operators and ex-founders who can open doors for you. If neither works, you can try (3) cold outreach. But these last two usually require a bit of courting. People introduce you more confidently if they *themselves* are convinced. That’s why it’s good to immerse them in your business plan first, so that by the time they make intros, they’re personally bought in.

### Scheduling Intros and First Meetings

Try to have all your introductions happen at once. Yes, literally, the same day. If you let them trickle out over weeks, you can’t run a parallel process. The intros themselves usually come in the form of a short email that mentions the fund, the partner you want, and a 2–4 sentence blurb about your company. [INSERT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE] would go here as an example of such an email.

Your first meetings will typically happen within a week or two of those intro emails. This can be *exhausting*, since you’ll be doing back-to-back 30- to 45-minute calls for days. During each first meeting, your job is to (1) explain your business and (2) figure out the VC’s process—how often they do investment committees, what steps they need to take before giving you a term sheet, and who needs to say “yes.”

Always leave with a next step. Even if it’s a simple, “Should we plan to check in after your Monday meeting?”

---

### Parallels, Not Series

Never run your fundraise in a strictly linear series: “Let’s meet Fund A first, then Fund B, then Fund C…” If you do that, you give VCs infinite time to drag their feet, and you lose all leverage. You need at least two of them to want to invest *at the same time* so you can negotiate properly. That’s also how you keep your timeline tight—if they know you’re simultaneously talking to other funds, they’ll move faster.

---

## The Data Room

Long before you start meeting with funds, *assemble your data room*. This means collecting:

- Formation documents  
- Past financings  
- Company charter  
- Board meeting minutes  
- Customer/vendor contracts  
- Employee agreements  
- IP/patents  
- NDAs  
- Any ongoing lawsuits  

And pretty much everything else you’ve signed. You might think it’s boring or “overkill,” but it pays dividends in speed once a VC shows serious interest. It also signals that you run a tight ship—always a good look.

---

## The Term Sheet

When a VC decides to invest, they issue a term sheet—*a non-binding but strong offer*. You’ll want to evaluate:

- **Investment amount:** How much are they actually putting in, vs. how much *you* need to fill out the rest of the round?  
- **Valuation:** Is it pre-money or post-money?  
- **Type of deal:** Is it on a SAFE, a convertible note, or a priced round?  
- **Governance/board seats:** Are you giving up a board seat? What veto rights or protective provisions exist?  
- **Tranches:** [NOTE ABOUT TRAUNCHED ROUNDS]  
- **Pro rata rights:** Does the investor get to maintain their percentage in future rounds?  

Even more important than the terms, though, is the quality of the investor as a future partner. You’re effectively marrying them for the life of the company. You should absolutely run references—both the ones they give you and your own cold references. Ask founders about how the VC behaves in tough situations. Did they provide real support when times got hard? Or do they ghost?

## Negotiating Leverage

If you time your process right, multiple term sheets show up around the same date, which puts you in the best position to negotiate. Without that second sheet, you’re at the mercy of your single lead. One trick I’ve used is to have negotiations without my co-founders present, so if a VC offers bad terms, I can say, “I’d love to do this, but my co-founders will never go for it.” It gives you a bit of wiggle room to push back, but *nothing* is as strong as having another valid offer.

Once you sign a term sheet on a SAFE for a pre-seed or seed, you should *immediately* ask for the wire. Lawyers can sort out details later, but your best chance of not letting the deal fall through is to have the money in your account. For Series A (often \$10M+), you’ll see more extensive due diligence, formal deal docs, representations, and warranties. At that point, your data room and disclosures matter a lot. Some founders try to minimize their disclosures, but it’s better to err on the side of over-disclosure. Surprises that come up after a round closes can poison your relationship faster than you think.

## Focus, Focus, Focus

Fundraising is a full-time job. It will devour your calendar, your energy, and possibly your sanity for the duration. If you want to close a round fast, everything else becomes *secondary*. In the past, I’ve delegated 70–80% of my internal responsibilities to my team or even appointed a temporary interim CEO. Your job is to raise money—burn down the funnel, respond to investor emails within hours, and don’t let a hot lead cool off.

---

## Seed vs. Series A

If you’re raising **less than \$10M**, you’ll probably do it on a SAFE. It’s cheaper, simpler, and faster than a priced round. The typical SAFE has a valuation cap and perhaps a discount for the next round. The simpler, the better.

If you’re raising **\$10M or more**, or your investors insist, you’ll go the priced-equity route. That can easily cost \$10K–\$25K in legal fees and require more robust diligence. Most founders do everything they can to avoid this overhead too early. But if the check size is big enough, it’s just part of the process.

## Closing Thoughts

Raising money isn’t rocket science, but it can feel like it if you’ve never done it before. The key is to keep a few big ideas in mind:

- Build a legitimately good business.  
- Make it crystal-clear to investors that it’s a good business.  
- Time your process so you have the leverage of parallel offers.  
- Stay organized: track intros, keep a data room, and never leave a meeting without next steps.  
- Go for at least two term sheets.  

And above all, *focus*. Fundraising can absorb you for months, but if you do it right, it’s months well spent.
