# DRAFT: SOME NOTES ON WHERE PITCHES GO WRONG

There's this thing that people do when they're pitching that I think is pretty broken. I don't know where it comes from, but it goes something like this:

- Founder names a problem.
- Founder describes how they validated the problem.
- Founder identifies a solution.
- Founder describes the way the core technology.
- Founder describes the team.
- Founder describes the competition.
- Founder describes the market size.
- Founder describes the GTM.
- Founder describes the funding ask.

This is sort of what you canonically hear in a how-to-pitch class where someone tells you, "This is how you make a pitch for a startup VC." But it misses this really core thing: these pitches need to be compelling stories. As a founder, one of the most important things you're doing is figuring out how to tell really compelling stories.

The easiest way to tell a compelling story is to find a compelling story and simply tell it. But a funny thing that happens is that founders find a compelling story and then they tell it in a very uncompelling way. This blog post is meant as sort of default reading for founders who I encounter who have this problem.

The first thing I do  when I'm helping a founder for the first time, I listen to the pitch and I simply report to them what the emotional feeling I have is on each slide. There are a couple of things that are really useful to think about:
1. What is the feeling that I'm having at each slide?
2. What is my attention level?
3. How believable is the story right now?

Note that virtually none of these are comments about the post themselves or the pitch. These are all just my raw reactions
