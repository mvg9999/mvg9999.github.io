# Who I am 
 Hi, I'm Marcus. 
 
For the past 6 years, I was the Founder and CEO of Luminous Computing, a company that tried to build supercomputers for training and deploying large language models. We raised $132M in financing, built a hundred-plus person engineering team, taped out a bunch of chips, and incurred a lot of brain damage.

# What I'm up to 
Right now, I'm still the CEO, trying to find a home for the IP. In the interim, I've been doing some interesting things, including but not limited to:

- Advising VCs and their portcos (Neo, Era/8090, and OVO)
- Executive coaching, trying to help founders do really hard things
- Writing code again
- Thinking about geopolitics
- Learning about game theory
- Catching up on way too many years of missed music 

This is my personal blog, which will mostly serve as a shareable scratchpad.
