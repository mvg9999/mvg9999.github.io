# Who I am 
 Hi, I'm Marcus. 
 
 For the past 6 years, I was the Founder and CEO of Luminous Computing, a company that tried to build supercomputers for training and deploying large language models. We raised $132M in financing, built a hundred-plus person engineering team, taped out a bunch of chips, and incurred a lot of brain damage.

# What I'm up to 
Right now, I'm still the CEO, trying to find a home for the IP. In the interim, I've been doing some interesting things, including but not limited to:

- Writing code again!
- Thinking about geopolitics
- Learning about game theory
- Catching up on way too many years of missed music 

I'm also now an executive coach, trying to help founders do really hard things. 

This is my personal blog, which will mostly serve as a shareable scratchpad.
